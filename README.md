- 👋 Hi, I’m @jjegicano, I'm currently in the mechanical engineering field with focus in HVAC/R.
-     I used to teach highschool math for 7 years.
- 👀 I’m interested in Learning Python and Javascript.
-     I always believed in continuous learning so I decided to learning some useful programming languages.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, since I find the syntax easy to learn.
- 💞️ I’m currently just in the learning stage so I'm not able to collaborate on projects yet...
